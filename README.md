# 2d Space Ship Orbital Mechanics Simulator

This is a little project to learn more about gravity and orbital mechanics as it pertains to objects orbiting a planet. At the moment the data for the ship's mass, velocity, and distance from the planet as well as the planets data, correspond almost exactly to the International Space Station and Earth. Notably missing from the simulation are atmosphere and atmospheric friction as well as any accounting for the fuel required for firing any of the thrusters and the changing mass of the ship as you do so, as well as obviously nothing being accurately to scale. I also intended to learn more about Vue3, though admittedly the organization of the project got more than a little messy and needs some work. Some future improvements I've thought of include offloading some of the more computationally heavy things like tracking the future orbital trajectory and eventually factoring in fuel using the rocket equation to a Rust backend, as well as perhaps caching more of the animations when possible.  

The controls are W to fire the main thruster and A and D to fire thrusters to fire the rotational thrusters and spin the ship.
